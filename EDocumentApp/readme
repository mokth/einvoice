I have created a Windows app that allows you to download documents from the MyInvoice portal. You can download documents submitted by yourself 
or by other vendors. These documents can be downloaded monthly and saved into local databases. You can review the historical data and check the 
contents of the documents. Additionally, the downloaded list can be exported to an Excel file for auditing purposes.

Download all the zip files (EinvoceDocApp.zip, EinvoceDocApp.z01, EinvoceDocApp.z02, and EinvoceDocApp.z03). 
Unzip them into any folder. Go to the unzipped folder and run EInvoiceDocument.exe. 
A settings form will pop up; just fill in the information. You're good to go.

- It support sandbox or live portal.
